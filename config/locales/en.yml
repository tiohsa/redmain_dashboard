  tooltip_completion_rate: "The percentage of closed issues out of total issues. Closer to 100% is better, but a low rate may indicate missed tasks or stagnation."
  tooltip_delayed_tickets: "The number of issues that are not completed past their due date. Zero is ideal; an increasing number requires reviewing deadline management or resources."
  tooltip_avg_lead_time: "The average number of days from issue creation to completion. Shorter is more efficient, while longer times suggest waste in the process."
  tooltip_wip_count: "The number of currently ongoing (started but not completed) issues. Needs to be appropriate for the team's capacity; too many leads to inefficiency due to multi-tasking."
  tooltip_burndown_chart: "Displays the trend of remaining issues. It's on track if the actual line is near or below the ideal line. Significant deviation above suggests a need for replanning."
  tooltip_velocity: "Shows the number of completed issues over recent periods. Consistently high values indicate good team productivity. A sudden drop may signal underlying issues."
  tooltip_version_progress: "Displays the progress status for each version. If progress is low relative to the due date, consider adding resources or revisiting the scope."
  tooltip_delay_analysis: "Detailed analysis of delayed tickets. Longer delays indicate more serious problems. Early action minimizes impact on the overall project."
  tooltip_tracker_dist: "Shows the distribution of issues by type. A concentration in specific types may offer insights into project characteristics and issue trends."
  tooltip_status_dist: "The distribution of issues by status. High accumulation in a particular status may indicate a bottleneck in the workflow."

  label_cycle_time: "Cycle Time Analysis"
  tooltip_priority_dist: "Displays the distribution of tickets by priority. A high number of high-priority tickets may indicate a need to review priorities or increase capacity."
  tooltip_cumulative_flow: "Displays ticket counts by status over time in a stacked chart. If a particular status keeps growing, it suggests a bottleneck in the workflow."
  tooltip_cycle_time: "Displays the average number of days tickets stay in each status. Statuses with long residence times are candidates for process improvement."

  label_throughput: "Throughput"
  tooltip_throughput: "Number of completed issues in the last 7 days. Zero indicates progress has stopped."
  label_due_date_rate: "Due Date Rate"
  tooltip_due_date_rate: "Percentage of issues with a due date. High 'Unset' count hinders planning."
  label_bottleneck_rate: "Bottleneck Rate"
  tooltip_bottleneck_rate: "Percentage of issues not updated for over 7 days (Stagnant)."
  label_assignee_concentration: "Assignee Concentration"
  tooltip_assignee_concentration: "Indicates if tasks are concentrated on specific assignees. 'High' suggests load balancing is needed."
